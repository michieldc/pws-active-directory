# pws-active-directory

This repository is made for a schoolproject. The problem is that I have 2 scripts instead of just merging them.

I wrote a report for each script seperately because we had to add multiple additions to the v1 script.

[Click here for the v1 report](report-v1.md)

[Click here for the v2 report](report-v2.md)
